You can go to [the demo](https://gatsby-starter-devto.netlify.com/) on what this is all about. Nonetheless, this is really very easy even if you don't know about GatsbyJS.

I have seen a couple of Dev.to API articles here and decided to make something useful with it.

If you already have a blog, this article is also for you. I have been struggling to create some content on my own domain because I feel no one would even bother visiting my site.

At [Dev.to](https://dev.to) though, I just keep coming back to write articles because I know someone would be reading it somehow.

Instead of cross-posting from my own blog to Dev.to, I thought I could do the other way around. I am introducing this very basic Dev.to Gatsby source that you could use with your Gatsby website.

[gatsby-source-dev](https://github.com/geocine/gatsby-source-dev)

If you do not know what a gatsby source or have never really touched Gatsby, you don't need to worry since I created a starter.

[gatsby-starter-devto](https://github.com/geocine/gatsby-starter-devto)

Here are the steps how to create your own blog using this starter:

1. Clone the github repository
  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:geocine/gatsby-starter-devto.git
  ```
2. Open `gatsby-config.js` and change line 13 with your Dev.to username
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    siteMetadata: {
      title: 'Gatsby + Dev.to Starter',
    },
    plugins: [
      ...
      {
        resolve: 'gatsby-source-dev',
        options: {
          // your Dev.to username
          username: 'geocine'
        },
      },
      ...
    ],
  }
  ```
3. Install and start
  ```sh
  yarn
  yarn start
  ```
4. Navigate to http://localhost:8000

[This](https://gatsby-starter-devto.netlify.com/) is how it should look like using my username `geocine`.

This is still a work in progress, I will be adding more features, feel free to create a pull request. I hope you like it.
