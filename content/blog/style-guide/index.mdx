Here's a style guide for posts on aivan.io. The first paragraph of each post is a lead-in paragraph that's styled automatically with the left orange line and a much larger font. Posts are written in MDX (JSX in Markdown).

## MDX & Frontmatter

aivan.io is an MDX-powered website, so every post starts with some front matter. Here's an example of the typical front matter for a post:

```yml

```

Store the blog on the `content/blog` directory. The parent folder of `index.mdx` which is `style-guide` will end up as your slug.

```
content/blog/styled-guide/index.mdx
```

## Titles & Meta

Keep article titles to a maximum length of 70 characters. Do include what framework or language it covers. For example: `How to Cook Lumpia With React.js`.

Articles should also come with a meta description that's between 80 and 155 characters. The meta description should give a brief overview of what the article is about.

## Headings

Use h2 and h3 headings. Capitalize h2 titles, but don't capitalize h3 titles:

```md
## A Great Title

Some text...

### And a great subtitle

Some more text...
```

## Colors

Here's a breakdown of some the site's colors, which can be useful for SVG graphics. Click a value to copy it to the clipboard:

<Grid templateColumns={['repeat(2, 1fr)','repeat(4, 1fr)']} gap={6}>
  <ColorBox color="#006cb7" />
  <ColorBox color="#ff8e01" />
  <ColorBox color="#8ac73d" />
</Grid>

## Bullet Points

Breakdown complex ideas or list of thoughts into bullets points. For example:

```md
- `Point 1`: Text for point 1.
- `Point 2`: Text for point 2.
- `Point 3`: Text for point 3.
```

Becomes this:

- `Point 1`: Text for point 1.
- `Point 2`: Text for point 2.
- `Point 3`: Text for point 3.

## Code Snippets

Here are a few rules for code snippets:

- Use 2 spaces for code indentation.
- Use single quotes in JavaScript.

Markup your code snippets like this:

````md
```javascript
console.log('Hello World!')
```
````

### Code Annotations

You can highlight specific lines of your code:

````md
```jsx {6-8}
function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
  return (
    <>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
````

This highlights line `6-8`, heres the result:

```jsx {6-8}
function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
  return (
    <>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Command line

For terminal commands, let's prepend each command with `$`:

```bash
$ yarn add react react-dom
```

## Separators

Use horizontal lines for separations:

```
---
```

It'll look like this:

---

## Info Boxes

You can add info boxes like this:

```jsx
<Message>
  I am an info box for a special note about the subject on hand.
</Message>
```

Here's how an info box looks like:

<Message>
  I am an info box for a special note about the subject on hand.
</Message>

You can also use warning boxes:

```jsx
<Message type="warning">You're entering the danger zone!</Message>
```

Here's how a warning box looks like:

<Message type="warning">You're entering the danger zone!</Message>

...and success boxes

```jsx
<Message type="success">Your app is now ready for production!</Message>
```

Hereâ€™s how a success box looks like:

<Message type="success">Your app is now ready for production!</Message>

## Links

Internal links should be relative:

```md
<!--  Avoid this -->

[Awesome Article](https://aivan.io/awesome-article/)

<!--  Do this instead -->

[Awesome Article](/awesome-article/)
```
