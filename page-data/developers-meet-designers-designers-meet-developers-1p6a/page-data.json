I am a developer who has an eye for design. </p>\n\n<p>That doesn't mean that I can do what professional designers do, I just know what looks good vs the obvious <code>not</code>. </p>\n\n<p>I do create my own opensource logos, templates, etc. But most of the time, I find myself copying other's designs or totally give up and head to Fiverr.</p>\n\n<p>I once had an opportunity to work on a project with a designer who knows UX and HTML/CSS development. It was an awesome experience.</p>\n\n<p>It was my first time to trust someone with a design which we both agreed. He was not just a designer, we both had enough knowledge to communicate requirements on our sides.</p>\n\n<p>Now, why am I looking if I already found a person who could work with me? Here is the thing, not all people are like you and me folks.</p>\n\n<p>We are the ones who have a very long list of TODOs that is piling up very fast but slowly being ticked. We are obsessed with new ideas which most of the time lead to half-baked outputs. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag__link\">\n  <a href=\"/dvddpl\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__pic\">\n      <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--71z_ROmN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PZ2wZedU--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/132615/9bcf8385-383b-4b64-b5cc-d8a9f4f675b8.jpeg\" alt=\"dvddpl image\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </div>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"/dvddpl/s-o-s-you-might-suffer-from-f-o-m-o-about-fear-of-missing-out-and-shiny-object-syndrome-23j4\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__content\">\n      <h2>S.O.S.: you might suffer from F.O.M.O.!

And no, he is not a designer, he is an awesome developer just like me.</p>\n\n<p>So how about, we start establishing an alliance where we can do stuff together. Let us build our portfolios together and work our way towards intentional career building. </p>\n\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":101257}}}
